# Recursion Methods

This project required creating a series of methods which use recursion. It includes tests (both standard and edge cases) to ensure that the methods are working as expected.

To see the codes in action you can clone into this project and then run `methods_and_tests.rb`, or you can simply navigate to https://repl.it/@daveyjones/recursion-practice and run it from there.
